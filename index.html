        <h1>Are Cats Actually Aliens?</h1>
        <p>What the actual fuck are cats, and why did they domesticate humans?</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Domestic house cats, it seems, may be alien sentinelsâ€”sent to spy on us and report their findings back to the mother ship. Or, as some theorists have put it, they're like alien camcorders tracking our every move.</p>
        <h3>Obscure Origins</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>There is no documentation before ancient Egypt that mentions the existence of cats. And in ancient Egypt, they were worshipped as gifts from the gods.</li>
          <li>Science is baffled by a cat's purr, and cannot determine how the sound is produced. (Feedback, much?)</li>
          <li>If you hold a cat's ears back and describe what you see, it is a perfect match to the classic "grey alien," with its almond-shaped eyes, small mouth, and small nose.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Unusual Behaviors</h3>
        <p>I mean think about it, they have the perfect way to blend in among us humans as simple pets and spy on us. I asked my own cat and he suspiciously refused to answer me.</p>
